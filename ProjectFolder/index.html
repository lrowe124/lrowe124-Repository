<p>The University of Maryland’s Gamer Symphony Orchestra (GSO) is preparing for their annual Spring concert on May 12 at the Dekelboum Theater in the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center, relying on their strong student organization to put on a memorable performance.</p>

<p>The orchestra remains one of UMD’s most unique and consistent student organizations, synthesizing students’ love of music and gaming to create a tribute to both. It is entirely student run and organized, from leadership positions to arrangements themselves.
</p>

<p>Started in 2005, GSO has steadily grown over the years, enduring through high peaks and very low lows, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their numbers shrunk to around 30 members, but have since grown to over 100 in the four years following the pandemic.</p>


<p>Senior inversive media design major Eva Ginnia began her time at GSO during this pandemic, and said that the growth since then has been remarkable. She is the orchestra’s social director, which means that she handles all responsibilities that are not music-related or executive related. She works internally, organizing social events and programs for members within the orchestra in order to establish and maintain connections. She is also in the choir.
</p>
<p>This means that she is familiar with the many communities that make up the social ecosystem of UMD’s Gamer Symphony Orchestra.
</p>
<p>“It’s just a really really great way to meet people,” she said in an interview. The orchestra currently has over 100 members and she is still constantly meeting new people within it. “I’m trying to meet everyone before I graduate,” she concluded in the interview.
</p>

<br>

<p>This is Ginnia’s second year as social director, and she said that she enjoys how the position enables her to constantly be in contact with the many different groups of people that make up the orchestra. She used her experience in the choir to help explain how close these groups can be.
</p>
<p>“My community really comes from the choir,” she said before continuing, “I see them four hours a week in addition to socials,” she said. Ginnia also talked about instances in which she was able to make friends and study with them in different classes from the choir, and said that she has had similar experiences in the orchestra more broadly.</p>
</p>

  <p>“I’ve met pretty much all of my friends through GSO,” she said with a smile.</p>
</div>

<p>In contrast to Ginnia, Blaise Ryan is one of the orchestra’s Public Relations Co-Director’s, and so he handles all outreach and other advertising initiatives. This includes the orchestra’s social media platforms, which Ryan has recently dedicated significant time to, especially Tiktok.
</p>
<p>“It is more of an opportunity to promote the casual side of promotional stuff,” he said in an interview. It was Ryan’s idea to launch the Tiktok, and he has taken ful advantage of the wide variety of content it allows him to produce.
</p>
<p>One of these forms is his “Get to Know GSO” series, which attempts to give outsiders an inside look into the people who make the orchestra a reality. He is happy with the results so far, and looks forward to making more content in this style in the future.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The junior cellular biology major actually joined GSO through his older brother, who played in the orchestra before Ryan began attending UMD. he comes from a family of musicians, as he as well as his father and brother play piano and he also has played the saxophone since fourth grade.
</p>

<p>He said that he loves GSO for the kind, inclusive, and large community it provides, allowing him to explore every unique musical passion that he has among like minded peers. One of these is arranging.
</p>
<p>All of the pieces that GSO performs at concerts have been arranged by orchestra members, both current and in the past. “We encourage our community to arrange for us,” said third year graduate student Neel Sanghvi, the choir co-director and member of the music committee.
</p>
<p>Opportunities to submit arranged pieces to the committee are available before the music selection process begins, according to Sanghvi and fellow member of the music committee, Robert Morris in an interview. Sanghvi explained that the council then provides feedback for each draft before the arrangers are given an opportunity to adjust their piece and resubmit.
</p>
<p>Sanghvi, Morris, and Ryan all arrange for different parts of the orchestra, and Ryan insisted that arrangers themselves have their own community where they work together and share feedback. “We hold workshops on the semi-regular where some of our more music-oriented officers help out arrangers,” he said as an example.

</p>
<p>Ryan said that communities like the arranger community provide spaces for him to exercise his creative sensibilities with others, and he looks forward to performing the product of these interactions in the upcoming concert. He especially is looking forward to performing his friend’s arrangement of a song from the mobile and flash game “Bloons Tower Defense.”
</p>
<p>Morris shares this excitement for the song, and also looks forward to conducting the song “God Shattering Star” from the “Fire Emblem” game series. Because he is also the co-director of the orchestra, Morris conducts half the pieces. This includes the grandiose “God Shattering Star,” which Sanghvi is also a fan of.</p>

<p>One of Sanghvi’s arrangements is being performed by the choir only, and so he is also looking forward to seeing how his work translates to a live audience.
</p>
<p>Regardless of how the two feel about their upcoming setlist, they both feel strongly about the community fostered by GSO and its impact on each of them. “It’s a big part of my life here,” Morris said towards the end of his interview.
</p>
<p>The GSO’s leadership are not alone in these sentiments, as the student-run structure of the organization has created an ecosystem that houses several lively communities within it. It is extremely accessible as well and provides a space where video game lovers and musicians can interact and talk about their interests, fostering meaningful connections in the process.
</p>
<p>The GSO will be putting the strength of these connections on full display at their concert, click <a href="https://theclarice.umd.edu/events/2024/gamer-symphony-orchestra-spring-2024-large-ensemble-concert" target= "blank">here</a> to reserve tickets!
