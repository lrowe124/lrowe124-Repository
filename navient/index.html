<h1>Tracking Navient Solutions complaints in the month of January in NJ and NY, 2015-2020</h1>
<h4>By Luke Rowe </h4>

<p>The Navient Solutions scandal has irreversibly altered the lives of many Americans. Tens of thousands of families were taken advantage of and were never repaid, causing outrage across the country. Complaints flooded the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) over years, ranging from student loan disputes to other financial issues. The infographic below contains two graphs, with the first being a representation of the total amount of student debt related complaints made to the CFPB in the month of January between the years of 2015-2020. The chart focuses on New York and New Jersey.
  <div class="infogram-embed" data-id="b898ae15-1636-4da5-8381-b5c82305683f" data-type="interactive" data-title="Navient"></div><script>!function(e,n,i,s){var d="InfogramEmbeds";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/b898ae15-1636-4da5-8381-b5c82305683f" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Navient</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

<p>Little growth is seen between 2016 and 2016 before skyrocketing in 2017 for both. Both state’s peaks are in 2017, with New York’s being 252 and New Jersey’s being 154. This makes sense, as the original lawsuits on the company were filed then. The complaints then drop significantly between 2017 and 2018, before leveling out to numbers similar to 2016 and 2017 in the next two years.
</p>
<p>The second of the two graphs contains two sets of bar graphs with the top set representing New Jersey and the bottom set representing New York. The yellow bars in each represent the total amount of student debt related complaints in the month of January between the years of 2015 and 2020. Conversely, the black bars in each represent the total number of complaints in the month of January between the years of 2015 and 2020, regardless of what type of complaint they were. These two graphs show how the large portion of each state’s total complaints were made in reference to student loans, illustrating just how large the issue was for college-aged borrowers.</p>
